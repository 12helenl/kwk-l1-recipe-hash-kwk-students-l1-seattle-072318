#1: Inside the `recipe_ingredients` method, create an hash called `mac_and_cheese_recipe` that has the following data:
#  - elbow pasta - 2 cups
#  - butter - 1/2 stick
#  - whole milk - 1 cup
#  - shredded cheddar cheese - 3 cups
#  All of the ingredients should be symbols and amounts should be strings. For the ingredients, you'll want to be sure to sub underscores for spaces and add a semi-colon to the beginning. #The method should return this hash.

def recipe_ingredients
  
end

#2: Copy and paste your `mac_and_cheese_recipe` hash into this method. Write code that returns the amount of cheese that is needed in the recipe, using the hash.

def amount_of_cheese
  
end

#3: Copy and paste your `mac_and_cheese_recipe` hash into this method. Use `puts` to print out every ingredient and amount in the hash by iterating through the collection. You'll want to use the `each` method.

def ingredients_and_amounts
  
end


#4: Copy and paste your `mac_and_cheese_recipe` hash into this method. Now use `puts` to print out just the ingredients without the amounts. You'll want to use `each_key`

def ingredients

end

#5: Copy and paste your `mac_and_cheese_recipe` hash into this method. Now use `puts` to print out just the amounts without the ingredients. You'll want to use `each_value`.

def amounts

end

#6: Copy and paste your `mac_and_cheese_recipe` hash into this method. Return the number of ingredients in the `mac_and_cheese_recipe` hash.
def number_ingredients
